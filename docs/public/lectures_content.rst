Short summary of lectures
=========================

Lecture 1. Introduction to technical track
------------------------------------------

Web scraping as a craft. Place of technical track in overall discipline: conceptually and
assessment formula. Technical track overview. Programming assignment overview.


Lecture 2. 3rd party libraries, Browser headers
-----------------------------------------------

Client-server architecture in World Wide Web. Types of HTTP methods:
``GET``, ``POST``, ``DELETE``, ``PUT``. Request. Response.
Python package manager ``pip``. ``requirements.txt`` as a manifest of project dependencies.
Library ``requests`` for sending
requests to server. ``requests.get`` to get ``html`` code of a page.
Making requests with ``requests`` API. Idea of mimicking to human-made requests.
Tip no. 1: random timeouts among calls.
Tip no. 2: sending requests with headers from browser. Obtaining headers.
API for sending a request with headers.
Check for request status: implicit cast to ``bool``, check for status code,
switch on exception raising.


Lecture 3. HTML structure. ``bs4`` library
------------------------------------------

Introduction to HTML scraping.
Key strategies for finding elements:
by ``id``, by class, by tag name, by child-parent relations, and by combination
of aforementioned approaches. Making requests with ``requests`` API.
Extracting headers from browser. Making randomized sleeps
in code. `bs4`: installation, basic API. Finding elements in `HTML` page with `find`, `find_all`.


Lecture 4. Filesystem with ``pathlib``. Dates
---------------------------------------------

Paths as unique description of file position. Paths: relative and absolute.
``pathlib`` as the recommended library for creating, writing and reading files.
Construction of paths with forward slash. Recommendation to build paths based on
``__file__`` global variable. Basic API: ``exists``, ``glob``, ``mkdir``.
Removal of directories: ``rmdir`` versus ``shutil.rmtree``. Removal of files: ``unlink``.
Date management as one of most challenging tasks in data analysis.
Module ``datetime`` to process dates. Basic API: ``datetime`` class,
static methods ``strftime`` for formatting dates and ``strptime`` for parsing them from string.
